# Content Consumption Analysis – Maruti Suzuki Internship

As part of my internship with Maruti Suzuki’s media planning team, I conducted an in-depth analysis of how customers consume content across OTT and traditional TV platforms.

This project combines structured SQL queries, Excel data processing, and real consumer survey analysis from 150+ respondents.

## Key Areas Explored

- Content preferences (TV vs OTT)
- Device usage patterns (Mobile vs TV)
- OTT platform preference (Prime, Netflix, Hotstar)
- Viewing time segmentation
- Skipping behavior & ad tolerance
- Age & geographic distributions

---

## Insights

- **TV still dominates** for 43% of users, but mobile usage is rising (37%)
- Amazon Prime is the top OTT platform (46% prefer it)
- 40% spend over 15 hours/week on OTT vs 31% doing 5–10 hrs on TV
- 48% use mobile for streaming; TVs are next at 39%
- 38% prefer 5–10 sec ads; 12% want to skip entirely

## Tools Used
